    <h2>Black Rain</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">
        In high school I majored in Theater studies and was assigned the role of stage designer as a senior. I designed the set for the Israeli play “Black Rain” by Shimon Buzaglo, which deals with the theme of the atomic bomb in past, present and future.

                The play was inspired by the animated British movie “When the Wind Blows”. Here you can see the conceptual art and sketches.

            I took the liberty to design the costumes as I visualized them.

                I drew inspiration from images of the aftermath of the atomic blast as well as the asian shadow theatre. The floor was covered with black shredded tires, as if it was nuclear fallout, and the leaning walls resembled the crater created by the bomb.
